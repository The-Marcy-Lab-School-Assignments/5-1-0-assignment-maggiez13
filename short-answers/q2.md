# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
A "has-many / belongs-to" relationship typically denotes a scenario where one class (the "belongs-to" side) is associated with another class (the "has-many" side). This relationship implies that instances of the "belongs-to" class can be linked to multiple instances of the "has-many" class, establishing a one-to-many relationship between them.

1. Courses and Students
        
      A course in a university can have a large amount of enrolled students. 

      Each course ("has many") can have multiple students ("belongs to"). In other words, a course has multiple students. A student can "belong to" one course, or even multiple courses. 

2. Library and Books (example given in repo)

    A library has many books. A book belongs to one library. 

    Each library ("has many") can have multiple books ("belongs to").

3. Playlist and Songs

    A playlist can include songs from various artists and genres. 

    Each playlist ("has many") can have multiple songs ("belongs to").
