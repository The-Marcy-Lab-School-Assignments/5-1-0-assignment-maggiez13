# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance methods and properties are defined in the class and its constructor. They are accessed through individual instances of the class by using the `this` keyword to refer to the specific instance's data. 

Class methods and properties are created using the `static` keyword and are accessed directly through the class itself, not through instances.

Instance methods and properties are specific to each instance of the class, while class methods and properties are shared across all instances of the class.
